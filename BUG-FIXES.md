# Booking System Bug Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. 🗓️ Date Display Bug
**Problem:** When selecting a date (e.g., Sunday June 22), the "Available Times" section would show "Saturday, June 21" instead.

**Root Cause:** Timezone conversion issue with `new Date(dateString)`
- `new Date("2025-06-22")` creates a date at midnight UTC
- When converted to local timezone (America/New_York), it becomes the previous day

**Solution:** Updated date parsing in two components:
- `src/components/TimeSlotSelector.tsx`
- `src/components/AppointmentForm.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
format(new Date(selectedDate), 'EEEE, MMMM d')
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Helper function to parse date correctly without timezone issues
const parseSelectedDate = (dateString: string) => {
  const [year, month, day] = dateString.split('-').map(Number);
  return new Date(year, month - 1, day); // month is 0-indexed in JavaScript Date
};

format(parseSelectedDate(selectedDate), 'EEEE, MMMM d')
```

### 2. 🚫 Disabled Dates Bug
**Problem:** Dates 23rd, 24th, 25th were showing as disabled/unclickable.

**Root Cause:** Missing time slots in the database for those dates.

**Solution:** Created time slots for missing dates:
- Added 9 time slots per day (9 AM to 5 PM) for dates 2025-06-23, 2025-06-24, 2025-06-25
- Each slot is marked as `is_available: true`

## Files Modified

### 1. TimeSlotSelector.tsx
- Added `parseSelectedDate` helper function
- Updated all date formatting to use the new function
- Fixed timezone issue in header display

### 2. AppointmentForm.tsx  
- Added `parseSelectedDate` helper function
- Updated booking summary date display
- Ensures consistent date formatting across components

### 3. Database
- Created missing time slots for disabled dates
- Each date now has 9 available time slots (09:00 to 17:00)

## Testing

Both issues have been resolved:
1. ✅ Date selection now shows correct day name in "Available Times"
2. ✅ Previously disabled dates (23rd, 24th, 25th) are now clickable and bookable
3. ✅ Booking summary shows correct date in appointment form

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use timezone-safe date parsing for date strings
2. Ensure time slots exist for all dates you want to be bookable
3. Use the admin panel's bulk time slot generation feature for new date ranges
4. Test booking flow across timezone boundaries

## Admin Actions

If more dates appear disabled in the future:
1. Go to `/admin` panel
2. Select the disabled date
3. Click "Add Slot" to create time slots manually
4. Or use the bulk time slot generation feature for multiple dates
